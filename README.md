Team Name: TripleJ

This repository contains the code for our team's prototype for the CyberYouth Singapore YouthxHack Hackathon 2022. The theme was Automation in Cybersecurity, and we chose to focus on Defensive Cybersecurity for this Hackathon. With our final prototype, we managed to achieve the Special Mention award in this Hackathon

## Securhythm
Our prototype made use of Machine Learning to try an idea called "keystroke biometrics", where users are identified and recognised through their unique typing styles
